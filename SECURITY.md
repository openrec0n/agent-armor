# Security Policy

## Scope

AgentArmor generates security configurations for Claude Code. It does **not** enforce them at runtime — Claude Code itself is the enforcement layer. AgentArmor runs entirely in-browser with no backend and no data transmission.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue (e.g., a generated configuration that fails to protect against a documented threat), please report it via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/openrec0n/agent-armor/security/advisories/new).

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a fix or mitigation within 14 days.

## Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure. Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
